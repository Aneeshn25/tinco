					   I am Aneesh Nelavelly born and raised in the southern part of Indian city Hyderabad. Where I have done my bachelor's degree in computer science and engineering and immediately got a job in a financial services technology firm FactSet Research Systems Inc as a web developer. That was my first job in a corporate field. It is unfair to say I’ve just learnt something in there. Firstly, I had no idea what a financial corporate company can do. Secondly, I’ve not once experienced any corporate collaboration. Lastly, I had no clue how my role can make a difference to company’s growth. Now I could say I've familiarized myself with all the barriers where I was concerned about after 6 months of experience with the FactSet. <br><br><br>
					   Meanwhile, I’ve realized that there is a lot to learn the working concepts of software development. I chose Lambton college, Mississauga, ON, to get a conceptual and practical knowledge of web development. I was succeeded in doing so and implemented some personal projects with that understanding.<br><br><br>
					   the fact that, for a moment I believed that there won’t be a scope of learning on the web development when people are moving to different other technologies. I corrected myself learning that whole world is moving to the web and it made sense that there is a lot to learn. I’m so excited and relentlessly passionate about learning latest technologies and trying out different other ways of implementing them in the work field. Now, this is the field where I see the adequate change, which is a chance of growth.<br><br><br>
					   I’m truly good at taking up new challenges at all time. My skill and interest in solving the math problems helping me today in finding the solutions to every logical task I try to do. I’ll be punctual and dedicated until the work gets done. As a result, my role as a member endlessly adds up a good value to the team. <br>
